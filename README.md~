## Simple Jekyll Editor

Jekyll is an awesome blogging platform! So I wanted other people to use it, but some of them wanted a tool to create content a lot easier.

That's why I started with this simple Jekyll Editor, to allow other people to jolt down their ideas, this will let people format the content and save the file as .markdown. so it basically automatizes the work of blogging with Jekyll.

I hope I can finish this job :)
